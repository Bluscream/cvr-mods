Very simple mod that automatically spawn a prop upon joining an instance (that allows props), while being able to
optionally exclude them from being removed when pressing the Remove All Props or Remove my Props buttons.

You can start using by setting the prop Guid on the melon preferences. Either by editing the config file or by using the
`UIExpansionKit` mod.

You can only have a single prop companion. This is by design to avoid people keeping a ton of props on all the time.
