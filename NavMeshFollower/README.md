This is a simple mod that allows you to control a prop follower. It's still in early development, so except bugs!
To get it working you need to download and install the requirements bellow, and then you need to spawn a compatible
prop. If you search for `NMF` or `NavMeshFollower` in CVR you might find some public ones.

## Requirements

- [NavMeshTools](../NavMeshTools/README.md)
- [RequestLib](../RequestLib/README.md)
- **BTKUILib** - You need to get it
  with [Melon Assistant](https://github.com/knah/CVRMelonAssistant/releases/latest/download/CVRMelonAssistant.exe)
  or [CVR Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/dndGPM3bxu)

## Custom Followers

You can make your own custom followers, but it requires a decent amount of unity knowledge! You can head to
the [NavMeshFollower CCK Readme](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_CCKs/tree/master/NavMeshFollower)
