This is a simple mod that allows you to control a prop follower. It's still in early development, so except bugs!
To get it working you need to download and install the requirements bellow, and then you need to spawn a compatible
prop. If you search for `NMF` or `NavMeshFollower` in CVR you might find some public ones.

## Requirements

- [NavMeshTools](../NavMeshTools/README.md)
- [RequestLib](../RequestLib/README.md)
- **BTKUILib** - You need to get it
  with [Melon Assistant](https://github.com/knah/CVRMelonAssistant/releases/latest/download/CVRMelonAssistant.exe)
  or [CVR Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/dndGPM3bxu)

## Custom Followers

You can create your own custom followers, but it requires a decent amount of unity knowledge!

[@NovaVoidHowl](https://github.com/NovaVoidHowl) made an awesome editor script/app that helps with the custom follower 
setup. I heavily recommend it as it turns something rather complex into a fairly simple process!

If you rather just get the CCK for the custom follower manual setup you can head
to [NavMeshFollower CCK Readme](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_CCKs/tree/master/NavMeshFollower) keep in mind the
readme is not thorough and requires knowing unity pretty well.
