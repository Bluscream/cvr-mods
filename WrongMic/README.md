## Retired ⚠️

#### This mod has been retired because it was implemented into the game as a native feature.


## Info

Really simple mod that saves the microphone depending on the platform. No configuration required, just install, change
the microphone with the usual in-game menus if it's wrong, and then forget about it. Say goodbye to people saying:
`Wrong Mic`!
