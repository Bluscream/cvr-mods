  "description": "Allows to override a few settings for all the pickups in the scene.\n\n__**Auto-Hold**__ whether the pickups will stick to your hand or not, to drop a Auto-Held pickup you need to squeeze the right grip and pull the thumbstick back (both on the **right** controller even if the pickup is held on the left controller)\n\n__**Maximum Grab Distance**__ sets the max distance you can actually grab a pickup. This is useful if you're tired of grabbing random pickups from across the world. Note: The pickups will still highlight meaning they can be tele-grabbed (the alyx style pull), but you won't be able to grab unless it is within the max distance.\n\nCheck [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/PickupOverrides) for more in-depth info.\n\n",
